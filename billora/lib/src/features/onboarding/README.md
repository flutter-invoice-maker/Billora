## Customization

### 1. Adding Your Images
1. Place your images in `assets/images/` directory
2. Update the `imagePlaceholder` paths in `onboarding_page.dart`:
```dart
final List<OnboardingSlide> _slides = [
  OnboardingSlide(
    title: "Welcome to Billora",
    subtitle: "Your smart invoice management solution",
    description: "Streamline your business with our powerful invoice creation, management, and analytics platform.",
    imagePlaceholder: "assets/images/your_image_1.png", // Update this
  ),
  // ... other slides
];
```

### 2. Customizing Content
Edit the slide content in `onboarding_page.dart`:
- **Title**: Main heading for each slide
- **Subtitle**: Secondary heading with accent color
- **Description**: Detailed explanation text
- **Icon**: Icon displayed in the image container

### 3. Customizing Colors
The onboarding page uses a dark theme with these colors:
- Background: `#1A1A2E`
- Primary accent: `#E94560`
- Gradient colors: `#16213E`, `#0F3460`

### 4. Customizing Animations
Animation durations and curves can be adjusted in:
- `_animationController`: Main slide animations (800ms)
- `_scaleController`: Button press animations (300ms)
- `_pulseController`: Icon pulse animations (2000ms)

## Usage

### Navigation
- **Skip**: Takes user directly to login page
- **Continue**: Moves to next slide
- **Get Started**: On last slide, takes user to login page

### Integration
The onboarding page is set as the home page in `main.dart`. Users will see this first when opening the app.
